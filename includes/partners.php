                        <h2>Partnerships</h2>
                        <p>Ikonic has partnered with various NGO’s locally to promote the welfare and vision of small scale farmers as well as that of large scale farmers. Ikonic Ltd partnered with The USAID-Kenya Agricultural Value Chain Enterprises (KAVES). Their project’s goal is to increase to improve the livelihood of Kenyans, ensure food security and nutrition, yield productivity and incomes of smallholders and other actors along the value chain, through creation of an enabling environment and ensuring sustainable natural resource management. It is envisaged that USAID-KAVES and Ikonic Ltd. target to enhance incomes for 50,000 smallholder farmers across 22 counties.</p>
